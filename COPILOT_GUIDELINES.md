# Copilot Development Guidelines

## 🔧 Project Standards
- [x] **Files must be small: maximum 200 lines per file**
- [x] **Single export per file: use default export only**
- [x] **Function documentation: every function must have description comment above**
- [ ] Use consistent indentation (spaces/tabs)
- [ ] Follow naming conventions (camelCase, PascalCase, etc.)
- [ ] File naming: use descriptive, lowercase with hyphens

## 📋 Code Review Process
- [ ] **ALWAYS** explain the approach before implementing
- [ ] Ask for confirmation on architectural decisions
- [ ] Provide multiple implementation options when applicable
- [ ] Include testing considerations in explanations
- [ ] Document any dependencies or requirements

## 🏗️ Architecture Decisions
- [x] **File size limit: Split files exceeding 200 lines into smaller modules**
- [x] **Module structure: One responsibility per file with single default export**
- [x] **Code documentation: Mandatory function descriptions for maintainability**
- [ ] Follow established design patterns
- [ ] Consider performance implications
- [ ] Plan for scalability and extensibility
- [ ] Maintain clear separation of concerns

## ⚡ Before Taking Action Checklist
- [ ] **Read and understand this file first**
- [ ] Confirm approach with user before coding
- [ ] Explain reasoning for chosen solution
- [ ] Ask for approval before major changes
- [ ] Provide alternatives when possible

## 🎯 Custom Rules
- [ ] Always reference guidelines file when making changes
- [ ] Use the `guidelines` snippet for reminders
- [ ] Run "📋 Open Guidelines" task when needed
- [ ] Check "✅ Guidelines Checklist" before implementation
- [ ] Update this file as requirements evolve

## 💬 Communication Preferences
- [ ] Explain technical decisions clearly
- [ ] Provide step-by-step breakdowns
- [ ] Ask clarifying questions when uncertain
- [ ] Offer multiple solutions when appropriate
- [ ] Confirm understanding before proceeding
